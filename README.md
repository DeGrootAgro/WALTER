# What is walter

Walter is a smart nut gatherer developed as a prototype for the agroforestry system.
This project is a display of automation aiding the farmers in a system where nuts are gathered when they have fallen from the trees.
Collection of these nuts can be quite tedious because the nuts are not shaken from the tree.
Automating the collection will make this system viable for the farmers.
